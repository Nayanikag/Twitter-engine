### Description

Implemented a twitter like engine in F# using AKKA actor model with the below user facing features:

- Register
- Login
- Logout
- Tweet
- Retweet
- Search Hashtag
- Search Mention
- Subscribe to a user
- Unsubscribe to a user

We have used web sockets to connect the client with the server. The UI looks minimally basic as the focus of the project was on the implementation of backend engine incorporating concurrency(through AKKA actor model) and websockets. 

Further details of the project implementation can be found in ReadMe.pdf
